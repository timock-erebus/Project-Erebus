  <h1>RESTRICTED ZONE</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the hidden archive. You’ve accessed a secondary vault known only to those who knew where to look.

  <div class="excerpt">
    <p>The man hated ferries.</p>
    <p>
      He hated the smell of diesel, the wobble underfoot, and the kind of people who enjoyed talking on boats — loud, sun-wrinkled people with hiking boots and time to kill.
      He stood at the bow, wrapped in a waxed jacket that hadn’t been waterproofed in years, sipping from a paper coffee cup that smelled faintly of bleach and contained mostly cheap whiskey he’d acquired whilst the captain wasn’t watching.
      It tasted like someone had wrung out a floor mop into it.
    </p>
    <p>He drank it anyway.</p>
